# Roadmap

To add some order to this project these objectives need to be completed.

[ x ] basic gui features (open file, save, quit)

[ x ] gui theme

[ x ] pane grid

### Tui
Being a hybrid editor this has to come soon. But after I finish the gui for the program to have one frontend finished at least.

### Explore: system shell in gui
A shell widget within iced seems the most simple out of the first few widgets and it is very helpful to users.
