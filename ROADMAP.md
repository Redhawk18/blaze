# Roadmap

To add some order to this project these objectives need to be completed.

[ x ] basic gui features (open file, save, quit)

[ x ] gui theme

[ x ] pane grid

### Program: file type recognition
* [ ] implement icons for file types

### Program: sidebar for plugins
* should icons be svgs or unicode?

### Explore: system shell in gui
A shell widget within iced seems the most simple out of the first few widgets and it is very helpful to users.
