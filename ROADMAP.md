# Roadmap

To add some order to this project these objectives need to be completed.

[x] basic gui features (open file, save, quit)

### Panel grid
Using the panel grid like the halloy project will give the program a more module feeling, with how windows within the program can be managed and moved. 

### Theme
After seeing [halloy](https://github.com/squidowl/halloy) made me realize how much better the app can look.

### Tui
Being a hybrid editor this has to come soon. But after I finish the gui for the program to have one frontend finished at least.
